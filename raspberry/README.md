This is the raspberrypi c++ code repository where most of the caluclation and work is done. 
This code acts as a brige between the outside (socket) and the arduino in victor (UART) which 
controls the movements of tracks and robot arm of victor. 


Building and Makefile is part of the common makefile and build is done remotely from deskop 
by sending g++ command over ssh.
